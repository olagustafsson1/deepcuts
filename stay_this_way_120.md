Living with you in my life
Is like feeling the whole world's on my side
Putting a smile in the place
Where a tear used to run down my face
Feeling the sun on my head
Where a cloud used to follow instead
Singing a song in my heart
In a place where all my troubles depart

If our dreams fall back on the ground
Then we'll make them fly
Let the rain keep falling on down
'Cause baby I'm high

Putting a smile in the place, That a tear used to run down my face
