Looking in my mirror, Took me by surprise

I can't help but love you, It's getting better all the time

I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no (x2)

Love to run my fingers, Softly while you sigh
Love came and possessed you, Bringing sparkles to your eyes
