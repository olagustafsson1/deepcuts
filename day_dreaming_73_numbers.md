Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Daydreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
[6m7... [6m7... [6m7... [6m7...

Look at my heart floating away
[4 3 1 5 [....  [4 3 1 b3 [....

He's the kind of guy that would say
"Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go some place, huh"
Where, I don't care
[6m7... [6m7...   [5maj... [5maj...
He's the kind of guy that you give your everything
And trust your heart, share all of your love, 'til death do you part
[2d11... [2d11... [5maj... [5maj... 

I wanna be what he wants when he wants it
And whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feelin' love starved
I'll be there to feed it
[2d11... [5/2... [2d11... [5/2...

I'm lovin' him a little bit more each day
He turns me right on when I hear him say
[7m7.3m7. [1m7.6dim. [..

Where, I don't care
(Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere far)
(Baby, can we?)
Where, I don't care
[2d11... [2d11... [5maj... [5maj... 
[2d11... [2d11... [5maj... [5maj... 

I wanna be what he wants when he wants it
And whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feelin' love starved
I'll be there to feed it
Lovin' him a little bit more each day
It turns me right on when I hear him say, ooh
[2d11...  [2d11... [2d11... [2d11...
[7m7.3m7. [1m7.6dim. [..

Where, I don't care
(Hey, baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere far)
(Baby, can we?)
Where, I don't care
[2d11... [2d11... [5maj... [5maj... 
[2d11... [2d11... [5maj... [5maj... 

thinking of you

Thinking of you
Daydreamin'
Daydreamin'
