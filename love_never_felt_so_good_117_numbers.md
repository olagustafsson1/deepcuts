Baby, love never felt so good, Michael Jackson, 117 bpm

[[[[ [[[2m7 5D11 b6D11 b7D11

Baby, love never felt so good
And I'd doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd doubt if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see
I can't wait, I can't take it
[3dim...[6Db9...[4M.3m7.[2m7.5D.

'Cause baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in and out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, in and out baby
So baby, love never felt so good

Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night through the thick and thin
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it cause

Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in and out baby
