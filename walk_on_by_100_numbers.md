Walk on by, Dionne Warwick, 100 bpm
Original key

[2m7... [2m7...

If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet


Walk on by, walk on by
Make believe
That you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve
In private 'cause each time I see you
I break down and cry
[2m7...  [2m7. 5. [2m7. 5. [2m7. 5.
[1m7...  [2m7...  [1m7...  [2m7..
[5m7...  [2m7...  [b3maj...[4...

And walk on by (don't stop)
And walk on by (don't stop)
And walk on by
[b7maj... [b3maj...[b7maj... [b3maj...
[b7maj... [b3maj...[b7maj... [b3maj...

I just can't get over losing you
And so if I seem, broken and blue
Walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by (don't stop)
Walk on by (don't stop)
Walk on by (don't stop)
Walk on
Walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by (don't stop)
Walk on by (don't stop)
Now you really gotta go, so walk on by (don't, don't stop)
Baby, leave, you'll never see the tears I cry (don't, don't stop)
Now you really gotta go, so walk on by (don't, don't stop)
Mmm, baby, leave, you'll never see the tears I cry (don't, don't stop)
Now you really gotta go, so walk on by (don't, don't)
