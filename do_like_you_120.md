Since age one Keita knew he had the answer
And it was that someday he'd be a dancer
And with help from his sis
Surely that boy would not miss
From being the baddest dancer in the whole neighbourhood

Late at night when he was supposed to be sleeping
You could hear the pitter patter of feet creeping
To where music would play
To his sister he would say
Before his father said, "Hey boy, get right back in that bed"

Once at school they put on a talent contest
To find out who could really boogy the best
But his mama said no
Keita's much too young to go
But his sister said please let him go so the world can see

When they saw him they said he must be crazy
Look at him he ain't nothing but a baby
But soon as he began
You knew the contest he would win
Because everyone in the audience began to cheer
