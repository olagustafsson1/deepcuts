Yeah, there'll never be a time where I'm untrue to you, yeah
You, you're always on my mind, tell me what can I do?
I've been through a string of affairs 'til I met you

You don't have to prove your love, 'cause it's plain to see
And life, life was a mystery until you came to me
And we'll have high hopes, but if they don't work out
We won't be dismayed
'Cause though love is our guiding force, and it will remain
