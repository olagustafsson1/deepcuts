I will love you anyway
Even if you cannot stay
I think you are the one for me
Here is where you ought to be
I just want to satisfy you
Though you're not mine
I can't deny you
Don't you hear me talking baby?
Love me now or I'll go crazy

Yes, you are
I wish you were my lover
But you act so undercover
To love you child my whole life long
Be it right, or be it wrong
I'm only what you make me, baby
Don't walk away, don't be so shady
Don't want your mind, don't want your money
These words I say, they may sound funny, but
