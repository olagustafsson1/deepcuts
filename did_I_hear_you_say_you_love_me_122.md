Did I hear you say you love me?, Well, baby, I got to know
'Cause if you really really love me, You got to do things to show
Don't give me the wrong impression, By showing me warm expression
Put me in the right direction, With tender love and affection

Trying to get on the inside

Did I hear you say you need me? Well, baby, tell me the truth
'Cause if you really really need me, My sweetness, here's what I'll do
Cut out all my crazy playing, 'Cause for your love I have been laying
Just tell me that is what you're saying, And I'll be yours without delaying

Well, if you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you)
If you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you), Sounds so good
Well, if you love me, honey, let me hear you say (I love you)

Did I hear you say you want me? Now please don't give me no mess
'Cause if you really really want me, You've got to give me your best
Put my love life right in the pocket, And dare someone to try to top it
And when you think I want to drop it
Just love me 'til I beg, don't stop it
