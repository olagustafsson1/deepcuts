Jammin in the basement, Judith Hill, 139 bpm

**\[Verse 1]**
Don't need no password
I don't need no cash
We got that good juice
So let's make it last

**\[Pre-Chorus]**
We better call up the baby
He got the magic stuff
And when we get it on the way
We'll be locked in a golden, golden, golden

**\[Chorus]**
We'll jam it in the bank, all night long
Jam it in the bank, to the police car
And we're going down, down, down, down
We're going down, down, down, down

**\[Verse 2]**
We got the best drink
In every bar
You know how to turn out
Just like a fly

**\[Bridge]**
My sneakers are perfect
They go to market
And when we get it on the way
We'll be locked in a golden, golden, golden

**\[Chorus]**
We'll jam it in the bank, all night long
Jam it in the bank, to the police car
And we're going down, down, down, down
We're going down, down, down, down

**\[Break]**
Jam it in the bank, friendly
Jam it in the bank, friendly
And we jam it, move, move
We just move, and we jam it

**\[Build-Up]**
And we go up, up, up, up
Up, up, up, up
We'll jam it in the bank, friendly
Jam it in the bank, friendly

**\[Bridge 2]**
Until the morning shine, we're gonna be in this together
And we got all the time, and it just don't get any better

**\[Outro]**
And we're jammin' in the basement, we're jammin'
Jammin' in the basement, jammin', yeah
We're goin' down, down, down
We're jammin' in the basement, jammin'
And we're goin' down, down, down
And we're jammin'
