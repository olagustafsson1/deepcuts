How deep is your love, as sung by PJ Morton and Yebba, 90 bpm

[F#^... [F#9... [B^... [Bm6...

I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
[F#. A#m7. [D#m7.D#9. [G#m7.A#m7.[C#11...
[F#. A#m7. [D#m7...   [G#m7...   [C#11...

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
[B^...     [A#m7...   [G#m7...  [E7#11... (or E9)
[A#m7...   [C#11--- (break)

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
[F#^...    [F#^...    [B^...    [Bm6...
[F#...     [F#/E...   [D#7...   [D#7...
[G#m7...   [Bm6...   

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
[F#. A#m7. [D#m7.D#9. [G#m7.A#m7.[C#11...
[F#. A#m7. [D#m7...   [G#m7...   [C#11...

And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
[B^...     [A#m7...   [G#m7...  [E7#11...
[A#m7...   [C#11---

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
