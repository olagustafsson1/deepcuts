Have you ever seen, Some people lose everything
First to go is their mind, huh
Responsibility to me is a tragedy
I'll get a job some other time, uh-huh

I want to join a band, And play in front of crazy fans
Yes, I call that temptation
Give me the melody, That's all that I ever need
The music is my salvation

Mmm, hmm, in the spotlight, The band plays so very tight
Each and every night, uh-huh
It's not vanity, To me, it's my sanity
I could never survive

Why don't you go get a job? Uh-uh

Not me, not now, no way, no how, oh, oh
