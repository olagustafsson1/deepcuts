When you're 35 or 40, and you chillin wit yo' shawty
Whatchu gon' listen to? Whatchu gon' listen to, if you ain't making nothin new?
If ya wanna just sample, Well I'm tellin you, ya gamble
You ain't even writing one strong song, You ain't even writing nothing to hold on
Late at night you wanna watch TV, Lean back and play a lil' Stevie (Stevie)
Play the music, play the music, Then you'll know why I'm talkin 'bout the

When you get a little older, and your nights get a little bit colder
Whatcha gon' cuddle to? Whatcha gon' cuddle to? Well it must be misty blue
Tell me what you got on yo' menu, Serve it up, I know that it's in you
Serve it up, serve it up, Serve it up serve it up serve it up
Listen to the music that made you, Tune in to what yo' mama played ya
Time to celebrate, time to create before, it's too late
Oh, go to your favorite place (Go to your favorite place)
Speakers bumpin, bumpin that bass (Speakers bumpin that bass)
Slow dance and what do they play? Betty and Teddy all up in yo' face!
