There's nothing like this, Omar, 72 bpm
Original key: Eb major
New key: G major

[1M9... [1M9... bass
[1M9... [1M9... add drums
[1M9... [1M9... [1M9... [1M9... add keys

Sip a glass of cold champagne wine
The rug that we lie on feels divine
And there's no, no, no, no
Parallel
For we two
[1M9... [1M9... [1M9... [1M9...
[4M9... [4M9... [1M9... [1M9...
[b7M7.b6m7 5D11    [1M9... [1M9...

Ecstasy the word of the night
Ringing in our ears, we're inflight
And there's no, no, no, no substitution
For what we have
No others can have
[1M9... [1M9... [1M9... [1M9...
[4M9... [4M9... [1M9... [1M9...
[b7M7.b6m7 5D11    [1M9... [b7M7.b6m7 5D11    [1M9...

There's nothing like this
There's nothing like this
No one could ever have what we have
There's nothing like this
[1M9... [1M9... [1M9... [1M9...
[4M9... [4M9... [1M9... [1M9...

Baduba wee ooh
[1M9... [1M9... [1M9... [1M9...

The lightest conversation has its flow
Aural communication, don't you know
And I feel quite content
Right now
[1M9... [1M9... [1M9... [1M9...
[4M9... [4M9... [1M9... [1M9...
[b7M7.b6m7 5D11    [1M9... [1M9...

Stick with me and we'll make history
An exclusive pair in love we will be
And there's no, no, no, no substitution
For what we have
No others can have
[1M9... [1M9... [1M9... [1M9...
[4M9... [4M9... [1M9... [1M9...
[b7M7.b6m7 5D11    [1M9... [b7M7.b6m7 5D11    [1M9...

There's nothing like this
There's nothing like this
There's nothing like this
Not even remotely like this
[1M9... [1M9... [1M9... [1M9...
[1M9... [1M9... [1M9... [1M9...

Guitar solo
[1M9... [1M9... [1M9... [1M9...
[4M9... [4M9... [1M9... [1M9...

Chorus
[1M9... [1M9... [1M9... [1M9...
[4M9... [4M9... [1M9... [1M9...
