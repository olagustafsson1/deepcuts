[1^...  [1^...  [4^... [4m7...

I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
[1^. 3m7. [6m7. 6D. [2m7. 3m7. [5D11...
[1^. 3m7. [6m7. ..  [2m7. ..   [5D11...

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
[4^... [3m7... [2m7... [b7D#11...
[3m7...[5D11--- break

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
[1^...  [1^...  [4^... [4m6...
[1^...  [1/b7...[6D... [6D...
[2m7... [4m6...

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
[1^. 3m7. [6m7. 6D. [2m7. 3m7. [5D11...
[1^. 3m7. [6m7. ..  [2m7. ..   [5D11...

And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
[4^... [3m7... [2m7... [b7D#11...
[3m7...[5D11--- break

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
