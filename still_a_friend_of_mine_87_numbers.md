You know as true as trees are tall, And autumn leaves do fall
Oh, it sometimes rains in paradise, And even the warmest heart can turn to ice
I know it happened to us all, Every kind of people fall
And after all the tears are gone, Do we have the heart to carry on?
Here and now, still somehow

To think of all the times I hurt you, And never thought it through
Oh, I treated you so badly baby, Could such a cruel heart ever be free
I know it happens to us all, Every kind of people fall
Ooh, and after all is said and done, Do we have the heart to carry on?

I know as long as I've got you
And we do the things we do
The next time baby that our love breaks down
I'll do the best that I can to turn it around
