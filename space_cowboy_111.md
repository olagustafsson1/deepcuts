Space cowboy, Jamiroquai, bpm 111

[Eb11.Fm7. [Ab11... [Gb^9/Ab...

Everything is good and brown
I'm here again
With a sunshine smile upon my face
My friends are close at hand
And all my inhibitions have disappeared without a trace
I'm glad, oh, that I found
Ooh, somebody who I can rely on

[Dbm7...[Cb^... [Ab11...[Ab11...

This is the return of the space cowboy
Interplanetary, good vibe zone
Say, at the speed of cheeba, you and I go deeper
Maybe I'm gonna have to get high just to get by
[Ebm7.Fm7. [Bbm7... [Ebm7.Fm7. [Bbm7...

Everything is good, oh, and green
Say, I'm red again
And I don't suppose I'm coming down
I can see clearly, so high in sky
A man with psychedelic picture frames
Of happiness to shade his eyes
He's glad, oh, that he found
Somebody who he can rely on
