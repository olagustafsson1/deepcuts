Gotta get up, Jill Scott, 75 bpm

I don't want to go to work today, I'd rather
Stay home and play video games, I wanna chill

I don't want to go to work today
I'd rather stay home and play video games
I'd rather chill for real, I don't know how you feel
But sometimes I feel like I'm workin' for nothin'
Tryin' to get somethin'
Everywhere I turn there's a bill standing out
Swim the river, climb the hill, complacency
You ain't gon' get me, no, no, no, no

Got to get up, gotta, gotta get up, got to get up

I'd rather be in my space, I'd rather chill in my place
So I can go out and play all day I, I'd rather chill at home
I'd rather lay alone, true but I got to work, I don't wanna go
I wanna play today but what can I say, bills to pay
I just can't get comfortable doing, doing nothin', nuthin'
