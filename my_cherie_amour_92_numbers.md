My Cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My Cherie amour, distant as the Milky Way
My Cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

In a cafÃ© or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My Cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

Maybe someday, you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, Cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
