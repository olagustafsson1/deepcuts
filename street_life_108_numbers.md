I play the street life
Because there's no place I can go
Street life, it's the only life I know
Street life, and there's a thousand parts to play
Street life, until you play your life away

You let the people see, Just who you wanna be
And every night you shine, Just like a superstar
The type of life that's played, A ten cent masquerade
You dress you walk you talk, You're who you think you are

Street life, You can run away from time
Street life, For a nickel or a dime
Street life, But you better not get old
Street life, Or you're gonna feel the cold
[6m7... [2m7... [3m7... [6m7...

There's always love for sale, A grown up fairy tale
Prince Charming always smiles, Behind a silver spoon
And if you keep it youngm, Your song is always sung
Your love will pay your way, Beneath the silver moon

I play the street life, Because there's no place I can go
Street life, It's the only life I know
Street life, And there's a thousand cards to play
Street life, Until you play your life away - oh
