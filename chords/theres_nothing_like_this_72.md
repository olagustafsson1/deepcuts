There's nothing like this, Omar, 72 bpm

[EbM9... [EbM9... bass
[EbM9... [EbM9... add drums
[EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9... add keys

Sip a glass of cold champagne wine
The rug that we lie on feels divine
And there's no, no, no, no
Parallel
For we two
[EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...
[AbM9... [AbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...
[DbM7.Bm9 Bb11    [EbM9... [EbM9...

Ecstasy the word of the night
Ringing in our ears, we're inflight
And there's no, no, no, no substitution
For what we have
No others can have
[EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...
[AbM9... [AbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...
[DbM7.Bm9 Bb11    [EbM9... [DbM7.Bm9 Bb11    [EbM9...

There's nothing like this
There's nothing like this
No one could ever have what we have
There's nothing like this
[EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...
[AbM9... [AbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...

Baduba wee ooh
[EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...

The lightest conversation has its flow
Aural communication, don't you know
And I feel quite content
Right now
[EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...
[AbM9... [AbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...
[DbM7.Bm9 Bb11    [EbM9... [EbM9...

Stick with me and we'll make history
An exclusive pair in love we will be
And there's no, no, no, no substitution
For what we have
No others can have
[EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...
[AbM9... [AbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...
[DbM7.Bm9 Bb11    [EbM9... [DbM7.Bm9 Bb11    [EbM9...

There's nothing like this
There's nothing like this
There's nothing like this
Not even remotely like this
[EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...
[EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...

Guitar solo
[EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...
[AbM9... [AbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...

Chorus
[EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...
[AbM9... [AbM9... [EbM9... [EbM9...

[DbM7.Bm9 Bb11    [EbM9... rit.
