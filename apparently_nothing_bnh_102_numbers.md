A popularity of invasion
Handed down through centuries
A force of arms called gentle persuasion
What have we learned from history

Human worth is so inexpensive
Compared to gold, the root of most wars
Subtract the tears from countless offences
What is left but guns and scars

I ain't trying to rule your mind
A conscious observer trying to find
A place on Earth where they heed the signs
Beware of conflicts that ruin unkind
If you want things move better
Withstand the tides of the bad weather
The struggle thrives when we all gather
Down at the bank of the soul river
