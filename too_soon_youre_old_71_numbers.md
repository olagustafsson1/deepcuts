Too soon you're old, Penny Goodwin, 71 bpm

[5m7...  [5m7...  [5m7...  [5m7...

Take your eyes from many strangers
Watch out, watch out for the worthless few
Don't socialize with fancy guys
They'll leave you from the start
Cause soon you're old
Too late for getting smart
[5m7...  [5m7...  [5m7...  [1m7...
[4m7...  [5m7...  [4m7...  [5m7...
[4m7...  [5m7---  

[1m7...  [1m7...

People always trying to tell you
Baby you'll be going far
Just take your time before you climb
To grab that shining star
Soon you're old
Too late, too late, too late in getting smart
[5m7...  [5m7...  [5m7...  [1m7...
[4m7...  [5m7...  [4m7...  [5m7...
[4m7...  [Am7---

Drop some acid, go to paradise
[?] fly high
Wake up, find the devil standing there
You know you paid the price
You know you paid the price
[4m7.5m7. [4m7.5m7. [4m7.5m7.
[1m7.4D.  [1m7.4D. 

Live your life the way it happens
Let it's beauty blow your mind
And that's the only trip to take
To yourself be kind
Cause soon you're old
Too late, too late, too late in getting smart
[5m7...  [5m7...  [5m7...  [1m7...
[4m7...  [5m7...  [4m7...  [5m7...
[4m7...  [5m7--- 

You better wake up
You better watch out
Everything to lose
Yeah you're gonna pay some dues
[1m7.4D. [1m7.4D.[1m7.4D. [1m7.4D.
[1m7.4D. [1m7.4D.[1m7.4D. [1m7.4D.

Tempo doubles (stressed out)
