Don't let your young life get you down
It always had a certain mystery
Many changes come to everyone
About the time that they turn seventeen
[1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. (1st gear)
[1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7.

Grandma said at times you'll feel a sting
There'll be sharp turns and uphills and closed doors
Then she said hold onto your faith
'Cause in this world you've got to go and get yours
[1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. (2nd gear)

So you stand up
Be strong go out there
Hold on to the real thing that matter
'Cause no one's gonna hand it to you on a silver platter
[1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7.  (3rd gear, cymbals)

[1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. (back to first, horn run)
[1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 5D11 . 

There's no need to feel you're on your own
Just let your intuition guide you through
Take one step toward what you believe
Don't be afraid to make your move
[1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. (1st gear)
[1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7.

In my head those words remind me what
Grandma said - at times you'll feel a sting
There'll be sharp turns and uphills and closed doors
Then she said hold on to your faith
Don't be scared go out there
[1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. (2nd gear)

Stand up, Be strong, go out there, Hold on
To the real things that matter
'Cause no one's gonna hand' em to you
On a silver platter
[1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7. [1m7. 2m7.  (3rd gear, cymbals)

Just stand up, Be strong, go out there, Hold on
