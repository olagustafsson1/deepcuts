Well, you by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around
Since I was born

And now it's alright, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, Stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, Stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, Stayin' alive
Stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, Stayin' alive

Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either
I really try
Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose
