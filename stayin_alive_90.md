Well, you by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around
Since I was born

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, Stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, Stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, Stayin' alive
Stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, Stayin' alive
