Don't let your young life get you down
It always had a certain mystery
Many changes come to everyone
About the time that they turn seventeen

Grandma said at times you'll feel a sting
There'll be sharp turns and uphills and closed doors
Then she said hold onto your faith
'Cause in this world you've got to go and get yours
[Gm7. Am7. [Gm7. Am7. [Gm7. Am7. [Gm7. Am7. (2nd gear)

So you stand up
Be strong go out there
Hold on to the real thing that matter
'Cause no one's gonna hand it to you on a silver platter
[Gm7. Am7. [Gm7. Am7. [Gm7. Am7. [Gm7. Am7.  (3rd gear, cymbals)

There's no need to feel you're on your own
Just let your intuition guide you through
Take one step toward what you believe
Don't be afraid to make your move

In my head those words remind me what
Grandma said - at times you'll feel a sting
There'll be sharp turns and uphills and closed doors
Then she said hold on to your faith
Don't be scared go out there
