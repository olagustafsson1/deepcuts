A long walk, Jill Scott, 76 bpm
Original key: Bm

[1m11... [1m11. b6maj/b7 4maj/5
[1m11... [1m11. b6maj/b7 4maj/5

[1m11... [1m11. b6maj/b7 4maj/5 add bass
[1m11... [1m11. b6maj/b7 4maj/5 

You're here, I'm pleased, I really dig your company
Your style, your smile, your peace mentality
Lord, have mercy on me, I was blind, now I can see
What a king's supposed to be
Baby I feel free, come on and go with me
[1m11... [1m11. b6maj/b7 4maj/5 X4

Chorus
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18
[1m11... [4m9. b6maj/b7 4maj/5 X4 walking bass

Your background it ain't squeaky clean (shit)
Sometimes we all got to swim upstream
You ain't no saint, we all are sinners
But you put your good foot down and make your soul a winner
I respect that, man you're so phat
And you're all that, plus supreme
Then you're humble man I'm numb
Yo with feeling, I can feel everything that you bring
[1m11--- [1m11. b6maj/b7 4maj/5 X4 (start only with Rhodes)

Chorus
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Revelation 3:17
[1m11... [4m9. b6maj/b7 4maj/5 X4 walking bass

Or maybe we can see a movie
Or maybe we can see a play on Saturday (Saturday)
Or maybe we can roll a tree and feel the breeze and listen to a symphony
Or maybe chill and just be, or maybe
Maybe we can take a cruise and listen to the Roots or maybe eat some passion fruit
Or maybe cry to the blues
Or maybe we could just be silent

Come on, Come on
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark

Elevations, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18

Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
