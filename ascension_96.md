It happened the moment
When you were revealed
'Cause you were a dream
That you should not have been a fantasy, real
You gave me this beating baby
This ryhthm inside high
Well, you made me feel good
And feel nice and feel loved
Gave me paradise, So
[[[[ [[[[ [[[[ [[[[  (no pad on keys)

Ref
Shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
And if you don't know then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder (Don't ever wonder)
[[[[ [[[[

Shouldn't I realize (Shouldn't I realize)
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder
[[[[ [[[[

So tell me how long
How long it's gonna take until you speak, baby
'Cause I can't live my life
Without you here by my side
[[[[ [[[[ (break last bar, accents follow vocals)

Guitar solo with envelope filter
[[[[ [[[[

You gave me the feelin', feelin', in my life, so

Ref x3
Shouldn't I realize
You're the highest of the high
And if you don't know then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder (Don't ever wonder)
[[[[ [[[[

Shouldn't I realize (Shouldn't I realize)
You're the highest of the high
If you don't know, then I'll say it
So don't ever wonder
