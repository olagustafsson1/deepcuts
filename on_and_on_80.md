Oh, my, my, my, I'm feeling high

Too much to see, The world keeps turnin'

Peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learned
If your knowledge were your wealth,Then it would be well-earned
If we were made in his image, Then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God, But they fear us just the same

The man that knows something, Knows that he knows nothing at all
Does it seem colder in your summertime, And hotter in your fall?
If we were made in his image, Then call us by our names

Oh, on and on and on and on, (My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone)
On and on and on and on, (All night 'til the vultures swarm)

I am feeling kinda hungry 'cause my high is coming down
Don't feed me yours 'cause your food does not endure
I think I need a cup of tea, the world keeps burnin'
Oh, what a day, what a day, what a day

[Em7./D.  [Cmaj.Bm7. [Em7./D. [Cmaj.Bm7.

You rush into destruction 'cause you don't have nothin' left
The mothership can't save you so your ass is gon' get left
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
